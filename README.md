Blackjack Reinforcement Learning using Monte Carlo Method: https://github.com/dolma012/MachineLearning/blob/main/monteCarloOptimal.pdf
  Implemented Monte Carlo control to find an optimal policy for the game of blackjack. The state space consists of the player’s sum (12:21), the dealer’s showing card (1:10), and an indicator for whether the player has a usable ace (no/yes), for a total of 200 possible states.
